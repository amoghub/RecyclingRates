# Recycling Rates Data


The main objective of this project is to compare NYC recycling rates to other cities across the U.S. The analysis and visualizations allow for a better understanding of how New York City recycles. Within this project, I will be able to showcase how NYC recycling rates compared to other cities and counties around the United States.

## Structure
When choosing the locations, I was hoping to find one state that would have great recycling laws and one that is neighboring NYC so that we could accurate comparisons. I decided to use Austin, Texas, and Trenton, New Jersey as my two locations. They were the perfect match that I was looking for, Texas having great laws and New Jersey being the neighboring state.
