Recycling Rates is a project that compares a New York City (NYC) OpenData dataset that contains recycling rates to other OpenData datasets from cities across the United States. I was able to make analysis' and visualizations that allowed a reader to have a better understanding of how NYC recycles.

All analysis' and visualizations were put onto a website for readers to view. Please take a look at each tab on the website, as it shows my process throughout the project and gives a great insight to how the visualizations were made. The code is also posted here on github for viewing purposes.
